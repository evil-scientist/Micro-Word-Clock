# Micro Word Clock v2
A fork of the Micro Word Clock designed by [formatc170](https://github.com/formatc1702/Micro-Word-Clock). I intend to modify the files to make this into a compact desktop clock with an inbuilt battery.


## Description
A tiny replica of the famous Word Clock, using only an ATmega microcontroller, a DS1307 Real Time Clock and a few passive components to display the time on an 8x8 LED matrix. The letters have been printed onto a transparent sheet and glued over the LEDs to produce a readable time.
See the YouTube video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ko9CeylUTs).

## Directory structure
- **MicroWordClock2-Arduino** contains the firmware, including pin definitions for the LED matrix and location of the words in each language.
- **EAGLE** contains the schematic and PCB design files for the proejct.
- **Graphics** contains the design for the transparency sheet to place over the LED matrix to form the words, designed in Inkscape. Contributions in more languages are welcome!

\* Probably any LED matrix labeled 788 should work.

You will require an In-System Programmer (ISP) to write the firmware onto the microcontroller.

## Burning the bootloader and uploading the sketch
Please read these two tutorials if you are unfamiliar with burning a bootloader:
- http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ArduinoISP
- http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ArduinoToBreadboard

The required procedure is the one described as "AVR on a breadboard" and "Minimal circuit", respectively, as there is no external crystal attached to the microcontroller.

Please download Carlos Rodrigues' Barebones ATmega Chips board configuration file:
https://github.com/carlosefr/atmega (instructions inside)

The ICSP header on the Micro Word Clock PCB is the standard layout described [here](http://www.atmel.com/images/doc0943.pdf) (Fig. 2).
